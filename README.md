# DM - Landing Page
This is the repository for the first project of a Challenge that i'm doing with a group with friends, where we'll develop 4 frontend projects and 1 backend project to improve our development skills, each of us will develop the same project individually, we'll compete between us and discuss about our codes, we'll also push each other to commit at least once everyday. 

**First Project - Tier 1**
It's not uncommon knowledge that webdevelopers usually start their portfolio, or even in their jobs with a Landing Page for a Product, so, starting with this premise, our tier 1 project is also a Landing Page, the project doesn't have a chosen Layout, as it's also not uncommon for customers to contact Developers and ask them to use their creativity, even though most of the time, we're not UI Designers. 

Basically, you were asked by a fictional customer to develop the landing page for a product or organization, he didn't gave you any example and also told you he doesn't have a UI Team, you'll need to use your own creativity to create a product that satisfies your customer.
